# Introduction

---

Hello there,
We are thrilled to have you here! Whether you're new or returning, our mission is to empower students with the skills, knowledge, and connections necessary to excel in Computer Science (CS) and enhance their university experience. We achieve this through workshops on trending technologies, community-building activities, and opportunities to apply your knowledge in real-world scenarios.

This guide is designed to help you successfully navigate the CS seas as a student at Brock University .

Throughout the guide, we will review everything you need to know about the Computer Science Program. This is an open-source guide for Computer Science students at Brock University. We encourage and appreciate everyone’s contributions to its continuous growth and development.

# Course Registration

As a first-year student, one of your first tasks is to register for your courses. This section is here to guide you through that process.

Start by checking the course requirements in the [undergraduate calendar](https://brocku.ca/webcal/2024/undergrad/cosc.html). Familiarise yourself with the page, including program notes and hyperlinks, to get comfortable with the layout and information.

## Course Codes

In your course requirements, you will see a bunch of course codes and it is crucial to know how these courses are structured.

For Example: The COSC 1P02 course code can be broken down as,

- COSC : The department which is offering the course.
- 1: Indicates the year the course is intended for.
- P: Represents the number of credits you get for completing the course(P stands for half-credit).
- 02: Department code for the specific course.

### Common Course Types

Here are some of the other course types that you will encounter when looking at courses:

F - 1.00 Credit

P - 0.5 Credit

Q - 0.5 Credit

C - 0.5 Credit (only required for co-op, and the credit is only weighted for OSAP but does not apply to your graduation requirement)

N - 0 Credit (only required for co-op)

Note: Every Major program requires 20 credits to graduate.

## Course Durations

Courses are offered during various times throughout the year and it is important to know which duration refers to which time period.

D1 is a full year course, starting from Fall -> Winter, taking up two semesters.

D2 is a one semester course taking place in the Fall, from September -> December.

D3 is a one semester course taking place in the Winter, from January -> April.

## Sections

Some courses are large and divided into sections for lectures, seminars, labs, or marking purposes. Sections might have different instructors but cover the same material. If you want to be in the same class as a friend, make sure to enrol in the same section.

## Context Credits

All students must include one credit (or two half-credits) from the list of Humanities, Social Sciences and Sciences Context Courses to fulfil their degree requirements. [Context Courses](https://brocku.ca/webcal/current/undergrad/areg.html#sec29) are mandatory courses intended to provide you with a broad educational background. For Computer Science students, the science context credit is covered by the program requirements, so since you are here you'll most likely need to focus on Humanities and Social Sciences context credits.

Students in four-year Honours professional programs must fulfil context requirements by the end of the third year of the program. All other students must have completed all three required context courses within the first 10 credits. You can find the list of context credits [here](https://brocku.ca/webcal/current/undergrad/areg.html#sec29).

Note: this should be cross referenced with the [undergraduate timetable](https://brocku.ca/guides-and-timetables/timetables/?session=fw&type=ug&level=all), as sometimes the courses listed here are not always offered.

You can use the [Course Planning Tool](https://my.brocku.ca/BrockDB/reg_CourseAvailStudent.aspx) in your my.brocku.ca student portal to check out all the courses that satisfy a particular context credit and check whether there’s space available, it’s waitlisted or it’s full.

Note: When selecting a context credit, make sure to read the course description and see that you are interested in the course. We understand that sometimes you just want to learn about your major but they are intended to provide you with a broad educational background. Sometimes, it can get frustrating trying to find a context credit that fits your schedule but we highly recommend spending time on this decision. An extra 15 minutes on this can drastically change your overall experience for the next semester or even the entire academic year. (In Jay’s opinion, most of the time there’s no point in taking a bird course, it’s a waste of time and money.)

# Program Requirements

## Credit Requirements for Bachelors of Science, Computer Science

| Courses Numbered |          1x99 or less          | 2x00 to 2x89                       | 2x90 to 3x89                          | 3x90 or above                         |
| ---------------- | :----------------------------: | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Credits Achieved | No more than 8 credits allowed | Must have at least 6 credits above | Must have at least 3 credits or above | Must have at least 3 credits or above |

Note: These requirements are subject to change. If you're in a specialized major then this could be different for you. Use this chart in tandem with the course calendar ( https://brocku.ca/webcal/current/undergrad/cosc.html ) to achieve your degree requirements.

## Minor in Applied Computing

(Note: This is the only minor that the CS Department offers)

Students in other disciplines may obtain a minor in Applied Computing within their degree program by completing the following courses with a minimum 60 percent overall average:

-     Four APCO and/or COSC credits

The applied computing minor is not available to Computer Science students of any kind, and APCO classes are only available to COSC students if they are cross listed as COSC classes, e.g. APCO 2P89 Internet Technologies is also COSC 2P89.


## Double Major


Consider a double major program as this might allow you to have more direction in your non-core computer science courses, and it may serve the advantage of allowing you to bypass courses such as MATH1P06 and COSC4P61, and of course add more qualifications to your resume. A popular pathway is the Computing and Business degree, however you can pair computer science with most programs in sciences, humanities, social sciences, and arts.
